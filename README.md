## Introduction

JetMoose is a modern Wordpress theme boilerplate designed to work with Vue and Tailwind out of the box.

The name is a wordplay between "Moose" which is "Ã©lan" in french but "Ã©lan" also means "impulse/momentum" which is perfect with a jetpack, so we've put a moose onto a jetpack and ... tada!

The project is MIT-licensed and open source, feel free to contribute!

## Install
